Loop is a mobile app that helps you create and maintain good habits,
allowing you to achieve your long-term goals. Detailed graphs and statistics
show you how your habits improved over time. It is completely ad-free and open
source.

## Features

* <b>Beautiful, minimalistic and lightweight interface.</b>
Loop has an elegant and minimalistic interface that is very easy to use, even for first-time users. Highly optimized for speed, the app works well even on older phones.

* <b>Habit score.</b>
Loop has an advanced formula for calculating the strength of your habits. Every repetition makes your habit stronger and every missed day makes it weaker. A few missed days after a long streak, however, will not completely destroy your progress, unlike many other don't-break-the-chain apps.

* <b>Flexible schedules.</b>
In addition to daily habits, Loop supports habits with more complex schedules, such as 3 times per week or every other day.

* <b>Reminders.</b>
Schedule notifications to remind you of your habits. Each habit can have its own reminder, at a chosen time of the day. Easily check or dismiss your habit directly from the notification.

* <b>Widgets.</b>
Be reminded of your habits whenever you unlock your phone. Colorful widgets allow you to track your habits directly from your home screen, without even opening the app.

* <b>Take control of your data.</b>
If you want to further analyze your data, or move it to another service, Loop allows you to export it to spreadsheets (CSV) or to a database file (SQLite). For power users, checkmarks can be added through other apps, such as Tasker.

* <b>No limitations.</b>
Track as many habits as you wish. Loop imposes no artificial limits on how many habits you can have. All features are available to all users. There are no in-app purchases.

* <b>Completely ad-free and open source.</b>
There are no advertisements, annoying notifications or intrusive permissions in this app, and there will never be. The app is completely open-source (GPLv3).

* <b>Works offline and respects your privacy.</b>
Loop doesn't require an Internet connection or online account registration. Your confidential data is never sent to anyone. Neither the developers nor any third-parties have access to it.
